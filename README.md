# Master_Thesis
This repository contains the code and experimental settings from my Master Thesis at CREATE Lab, EPFL, carried out under the supervision of professor Josie Hughes. The project focuses on vision-based reconstruction and feedback control of a soft robotic arm, combining machine learning, computer vision, and soft robotics for closed-loop control.
